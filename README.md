# Etch-a-Sketch

I learned quite a bit with this project:
- How to create elements via DOM and how fun it is;
- How using functions can require a shared scope with data variables and how much I want to learn about JS objects already;
- How to write *better* commit messages, but whether or not they are good is something only time and experience will tell;
- How programming is awesome! I did some VERY light coding in the past, but never a project this big â€” and I can't wait for even bigger projects!
